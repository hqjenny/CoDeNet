# HLS Project

The source code of the HLS-based accelerator is under [top](top) subdirection. 
We also provide an archive of the HLS project containing the CoDeNet accelerator code   
[here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~qijing.huang/2021FPGA/CoDeNet_hls.zip).

Please unzip the file `unzip CoDeNet_hls.zip`, open Vivado HLS GUI, and load the project. 

The Vivado Project and Block Design files can be downloaded [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~qijing.huang/2021FPGA/CoDeNet.xpr.zip). 

Please load the archived project and update the HLS accelerator path.
